# Functions

# Sourcing .R files

Having developed some useful functions, we might want to re-use them in a future project or share them with a friend. Save your functions in a file called "myfunctions.R". They can now be loaded with:

```
source("myfunctions.R")
```


# Running external software



# Putting it all together
