This section looks at working with sequences, primarily DNA sequences, and genomic features.

We will be using Bioconductor packages for this. Recall that most R packages are available on the CRAN package repository, and installed using `install.packages()`. Bioconductor is another specialized repository devoted to bioinformatics R packages.

Bioconductor represents a different strand of current development in R, separate from the Hadley Wickham tidyverse. Where Hadley emphasizes the data frame above all else, Bioconductor uses a great variety of data types. It's the very opposite of tidy!

Nevertheless, Bioconductor is overwhelmingly *comprehensive*, and represents the most *complete* environment available for working with bioinformatic data currently existing.
